## GENERAL INFORMATION 

#### MEGA 1284P is an open-source microcontroller based on the ATmega1284P. It features 24 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be PWM outputs), 8 analog input pins, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, an ICSP pin header, a reset button, and an LED is connected to pin 13. To power the microcontroller you can use the 5 volts of the serial or from 7 volts to 35 volts from the Vin pin (use one of the two methods, not both together).

## HOW TO UPLOAD SKETCHES USING SERIAL PORT (UART)

First of all you need a USB TTL FTDI (like this https://t.ly/cMAf or this https://t.ly/RZF8) that will allow the sketch to be written to the microcontroller. First, however, preliminary operation must be carried out: 

- Burning the bootloader (visit this link for more information: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/ArduinoToBreadboard)

Connection between FTDI and MEGA 1284P:
